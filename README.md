# Cloud Foundry Routing [BOSH release]

This repo is a [BOSH release](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh) that delivers HTTP and TCP routing for Cloud Foundry.

## Developer Workflow

When working on individual components of TCP Router, work out of the submodules under `src/`.

Run the individual component unit tests as you work on them using
[ginkgo](https://github.com/onsi/ginkgo).

Commits to this repo (including Pull Requests) should be made on the Develop branch.

### Get the code

1. Fetch release repo

    ```
    mkdir -p ~/workspace
    cd ~/workspace
    git clone https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/routing-release.git
    cd routing-release/
    ```


1. Automate `$GOPATH` and `$PATH` setup

    This BOSH release doubles as a `$GOPATH`. It will automatically be set up for you if you have [direnv](http://direnv.net) installed.


    ```
    direnv allow
    ```

    If you do not wish to use direnv, you can simply `source` the `.envrc` file in the root of the release repo.  You may manually need to update your `$GOPATH` and `$PATH` variables as you switch in and out of the directory.


1. Initialize and sync submodules


    ```
    ./scripts/update
    ```

### Running Unit Tests

1. Install ginkgo

        go install github.com/onsi/ginkgo/ginkgo

2. Run unit tests

        ./scripts/run-unit-tests

## Deploying to BOSH-Lite

### Prerequisites

1. Install and start [BOSH Lite](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-lite). Instructions can be found on that repo's README.
- Upload the latest Warden Trusty Go-Agent stemcell to BOSH Lite. You can download it first if you prefer.

	```
	bosh upload stemcell https://bosh.io/d/stemcells/bosh-warden-boshlite-ubuntu-trusty-go_agent
	```
- Install spiff, a tool for generating BOSH manifests. spiff is required for running the scripts in later steps. Stable binaries can be downloaded from [Spiff Releases](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/spiff/releases).
- Deploy [cf-release](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-release) and [diego-release](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/diego-release).

> **Note**: for IAAS other than BOSH Lite, cf-release must be configured so
> that UAA terminates SSL; see [Deploying to Other
> IAAS](#deploying-to-other-iaas).

### Upload Release, Generate Manifest, and Deploy
1. Clone this repo and sync submodules; see [Get the code](#get-the-code).
- Upload routing-release to BOSH and generate a deployment manifest

    * Deploy the latest final release (master branch)

            cd ~/workspace/routing-release
            bosh -n upload release releases/routing-<lastest_version>.yml
            ./scripts/generate-bosh-lite-manifest
            bosh -n deploy

    * Or deploy from some other branch. The `release-candidate` branch can be considered "edge" as it has passed tests. The `update` script handles syncing submodules, among other things.

            cd ~/workspace/routing-release
            git checkout release-candidate
            ./scripts/update
            bosh create release --force
            bosh -n upload release
            ./scripts/generate-bosh-lite-manifest
            bosh -n deploy

	The `generate-bosh-lite-manifest` script expects the cf-release and diego-release manifests to be at `~/workspace/cf-release/bosh-lite/deployments/cf.yml` and `~/workspace/diego-release/bosh-lite/deployments/diego.yml`; the BOSH Lite manifest generation scripts for those releases will put them there by default. If cf and diego manifests are in a different location then you may specify them as arguments:

        ./scripts/generate-bosh-lite-manifest <cf_deployment_manifest> <diego_deployment_manifest>

> **Note**: for IAAS other than BOSH Lite, consider whether the reservable port
> range should be modified; see [Deploying to Other
> IAAS](#deploying-to-other-iaas).

### Redeploy cf-release to Enable the Routing API

Finally, update your cf-release deployment to enable the Routing API included in this release.

1. If you don't already have one, create a file for overriding manifest properties of cf-release. In the context of manifest generation, we call this file a stub; you could name it `cf-boshlite-stub.yml`. Add the following properties to this file. When you re-generate the manifest, these values will override the defaults in the manifest.

	```
	properties:
	  cc:
	    default_to_diego_backend: true
	  routing_api:
	    enabled: true
	```
	Though not strictly required, we recommend configuring Diego as your default backend, as TCP Routing is only supported for Diego.
- Then generate a new manifest for cf-release and re-deploy it.

		cd ~/workspace/cf-release
		./scripts/generate-bosh-lite-dev-manifest <path-to-your-stub>
		bosh -n deploy

### Post Deploy Configuration

Now that the release is deployed, you need to create a Shared Domain in CF and associate it with the TCP router group deployed with this release.

The CLI commands below require version 6.17 of the [cf CLI](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli), and must be run as admin.

1. List available router-groups

	```
	$ cf router-groups
	Getting router groups as admin ...

	name          type
	default-tcp   tcp
	```
- Create a shared-domain for the TCP router group

	```
	$ cf create-shared-domain tcp.bosh-lite.com --router-group default-tcp
	Creating shared domain tcp.bosh-lite.com as admin...
	OK
	```

> **Note**: For IAAS other than BOSH Lite, you will need to update a quota to
> grant permission for creating TCP routes. See [Deploying to Other
> IAAS](#deploying-to-other-iaas)

- Update the default quota to allow creation of unlimited TCP Routes

	Get the guid of the default org quota
	```
	$ cf curl /v2/quota_definitions?q=name:default
	```
	Update this quota definition to set `"total_reserved_route_ports": -1`
	```
	$ cf curl /v2/quota_definitions/44dff27d-96a2-44ed-8904-fb5ca8cbb298 -X PUT -d '{"total_reserved_route_ports": -1}'
	```

> **Note**: If you receive this error: `FAILED This command requires the
> Routing API. Your targeted endpoint reports it is not enabled`. This is due
> to the CF CLI's `~/.cf/config.json` having an old cached `RoutingEndpoint`
> value. To fix this, just do a cf login again and this error should go away.

### Create a TCP Route

The CLI commands below require version 6.17+ of the [cf CLI](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli), and can be run as a user with the SpaceDeveloper role.

1. The simplest way to test TCP Routing is by pushing your app. By specifying the TCP domain and including the `--random-route` option, a TCP route will be created with a reserved port and the route mapped to your app.

	`$ cf p myapp -d tcp.bosh-lite.com --random-route`
- Send a request to your app using the TCP shared domain and the port reserved for your route.

	```
	$ curl tcp.bosh-lite.com:60073
	OK!
	```



## Deploying to other IAAS

BOSH Lite is a single VM environment intended for development. When deploying this release alongside Cloud Foundry in a distributed configuration, where jobs run on their own VMs, consider the following.

### UAA configuration

UAA needs to be configured with correct hostname so that routing components can
contact it. If you are using the manifest generation scripts for cf-release, the 
following properties have been enabled by default. However, if you override the 
`uaa.zones.internal.hostnames` property yourself, make sure to include `uaa.service.cf.internal` 
in your stub.

```
properties:
  uaa:
    zones:
      internal:
        hostnames:
        - uaa.service.cf.internal
```

### UAA SSL must be enabled before deploying this release

The BOSH Lite manifest generation scripts use templates that have enabled the following properties by default. When generating a manifest for any other environment, you'll need to update your cf-release deployment with these manifest properties before generating the manifest for this release. This release's manifest generation scripts pull the value of `uaa.ssl.port` from the cf-release manifest.

		properties:
		  uaa:
		    ssl:
		      port: <choose a port for UAA to listen to SSL on; e.g. 8443>
		    sslCertificate: |
		      <insert certificate>
		    sslPrivateKey: |
		      <insert private key>

### OAuth clients in UAA

The following clients must be configured in UAA. If you're using the manifest generation scripts for cf-release, you can skip this step as the necessary clients are in the Spiff templates. If you're handrolling your manifest for cf-release, you'll need to add them.

```
properties:
  uaa:
    clients:
      cc_routing:
        authorities: routing.router_groups.read
        authorized-grant-types: client_credentials
        secret: <your-secret>
      gorouter:
        authorities: routing.routes.read
        authorized-grant-types: client_credentials,refresh_token
        secret: <your-secret>
      tcp_emitter:
        authorities: routing.routes.write,routing.routes.read,routing.router_groups.read
        authorized-grant-types: client_credentials,refresh_token
        secret: <your-secret>
      tcp_router:
        authorities: routing.routes.read,routing.router_groups.read
        authorized-grant-types: client_credentials,refresh_token
        secret: <your-secret>
```

### Horizontal Scalability

The TCP Router, TCP Emitter, and Routing API are stateless and horizontally scalable. Routing API depends on a clustered etcd data store. For high availability, deploy multiple instances of each job, distributed across regions of your infrastructure.

### Configuring Your Load Balancer to Health Check TCP Routers

In order to determine whether TCP Router instances are eligible for routing requests to, configure your load balancer to periodically check the health of each instance by attempting a TCP connection. By default the health check port is 80. This port can be configured using the `haproxy.health_check_port` property in the `property-overrides.yml` stub file.

To simulate this health check manually:
  ```
  nc -vz <tcp router IP> 80
  Connection to <tcp router IP> port 80 [tcp/http] succeeded!
  ```

### Configuring Port Ranges and DNS
1. Configure your load balancer to forward a range of ports to the IPs of the
   TCP Router instances. By default, this release assumes the range 1024-65535
   will be forwarded.
- If your load balancer is not configured to forward ports 1024-65535, you must
  configure this release with the available port range using deployment
  manifest property `routing-api.router_groups.reservable_ports`
- Configure DNS to resolve a domain name to the load balancer.
- After deploying this release you must configure the DNS name in CF as a
  Shared Domain as an admin user, associating it with the Router Group.
  ```
  Getting router groups as admin ...

  name          type
  default-tcp   tcp

  $ cf create-shared-domain tcp.cfapps.example.com --router-group default-tcp
  ```

#### Capacity Limits for Ports and TCP Routes
One port is dedicated for each TCP route in CF; in other words, TCP routes may not share ports.

A Router Group represents a horizontally scalable cluster of identically
configured routers. A router group is limited to maximum port range 1024-65535.
Currently this release supports one router group, so the maximum number of TCP
routes than can be created in CF is 64512 (65535-1024). Eventually we may
support multiple router groups and/or TCP routes that share a port.

#### Using Multiple Load Balancers to Maximize Port Capacity
Operators may not be able to offer 64512 ports on a given load balancer. The load balancer may support other systems in addition to Cloud Foundry. AWS ELBs can be configured to listen on a maximum of 100 ports.

Multiple load balancers may be used to contribute to the pool of ports
available for creating TCP routes. E.g. LB1 listens on ports 1024-29999, LB2
listens on ports 30000-65535, both load balancers forward requests for these
ports to the instances of the router group. Configure
`routing-api.router_groups.reservable_ports` manifest property with the
combined port range. Ports must not overlap.

You must configure a DNS name to resolve to each load balancer you use for TCP routing. E.g. `tcp1.cfapps.example.com` resolves to LB1, `tcp2.cfapps.example.com` resolves to LB2. Each domain name must be added as a Shared Domain to CF, for developers to create routes from.

## Running Acceptance tests

### Using a BOSH errand on BOSH-Lite

Before running the acceptance tests errand, make sure to have the following setup.

1. bosh is targeted to your local bosh-lite
1. routing-release [deployed](#deploying-tcp-router-to-a-local-bosh-lite-instance) on bosh-lite

Run the following commands to execute the acceptance tests as an errand on bosh-lite

```
bosh run errand router_acceptance_tests
```
