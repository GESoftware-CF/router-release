# We put our own configuration into .rubocop_routing.yml to let it be
# overwritten buy .rubocop_todo.yml.
# The .rubocop_todo.yml is autogenerated with `rubocop --regenerate-todo` and
# ignores old errors for new cops
# Then one can, one by one, remove to ignore from the .rubocop_todo.yml file
# and work on applying new cops also to old codebase.
#
# This was adapted from [cloudfoundry/cloud_controller_ng](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cloud_controller_ng/blob/a6febf66cf9cf7c86b27b917df9b111b874b6972/.rubocop.yml)
